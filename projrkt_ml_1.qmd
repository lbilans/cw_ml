## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(parsnip)

# Helper packages
library(readr)# import danych
library(broom.mixed) # konwersja 
library(dotwhisker)  # wizualizacja
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
urchins <-
  read_csv("https://tidymodels.org/start/models/urchins.csv") %>% 
  setNames(c("food_regime", "initial_volume", "width")) %>% 
  mutate(food_regime = factor(food_regime, 
                              levels = c("Initial", "Low", "High")))
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
